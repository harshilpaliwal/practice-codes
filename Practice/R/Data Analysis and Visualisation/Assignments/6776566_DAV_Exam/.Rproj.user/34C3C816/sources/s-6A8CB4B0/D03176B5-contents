Dataset details:
The dataset is downloaded from Kaggel. It is Star Classifier, i.e., it is a compliation of various properties of stars in the universe. It has columns that show following details of a star: Temperature,Luminosity,Radius,Absolute magnitude,Star type,Star color and Spectral Class.

Operations Performed:
In this assignment, I have tried to explore this data set and have tried to find various relations between properties, for example: whether star of some "type" are brighter(have more luminosity) than stars of other "type". I also tried to find out the biggest star and the brightest star according to the dataset.
By performing these operations on the dataset, I learned about using various R functionalities and also a lot about properties of a star. One of the most interesting fact that I came to know from this is that even though the size of star is related to its brightness, that doesnot mean that the brightest star will be hottest.

#importing dataset
```{r}
star_dataset <- read.csv("~/Programming/R/Data Analysis and Visualisation/Assignments/6776566Exploratory_Data_Analysis/data/star_dataset.csv")
```

#getting a glimpse of the dataset
```{r}
head(star_dataset)
```

#getting summary of the dataset
```{r}
summary(star_dataset)
```
#we do not want to use scientific notations in R
```{r}
options(scipen=999)
```

 
#applying filter function to the dataset. This gives us all the stars of colour Blue.
```{r}
star_dataset %>% filter(Star.color == "Blue" & Radius.R.Ro. > 100)
```

#applying arrange function to the dataset. This gives us a Blue star with lowest temprature.
```{r}
star_dataset %>% filter(Star.color == "Blue" & Radius.R.Ro. > 100) %>% arrange(Temperature..K.)
```

#applying select function to the dataset
```{r}
star_dataset %>% filter(Star.color == "Blue" & Radius.R.Ro. > 100) %>% arrange(Temperature..K.) %>%
select(Luminosity.L.Lo., Spectral.Class)
```

#Finding the biggest star
```{r}
max(star_dataset$Radius.R.Ro.) 
star_dataset %>% filter(Radius.R.Ro. == 1948.5) %>% select(Temperature..K., Luminosity.L.Lo., Radius.R.Ro., Absolute.magnitude.Mv., Star.type, Star.color, Spectral.Class)
```

#Finding the brightest star
```{r}
max(star_dataset$Luminosity.L.Lo.) 
star_dataset %>% filter(Luminosity.L.Lo. == 849420) %>% select(Temperature..K., Luminosity.L.Lo., Radius.R.Ro., Absolute.magnitude.Mv., Star.type, Star.color, Spectral.Class)
```


#Creating plots

#This plot shows that stars of type 4 and 5 are brighter than others.
```{r}
plot(x = star_dataset$Star.type, y = star_dataset$Luminosity.L.Lo., xlab = "Type", ylab = "Brightness")
```


#This plot shows the same results but here I have used geom_pont and geom_density.
```{r}
TypeBright <- ggplot(star_dataset, aes(x = Star.type, y = Luminosity.L.Lo.)) + geom_point() +
labs(x = "Type", y = "Brightness", title = "Plot showing how the Type of a star affects its luminosity") + geom_density_2d() + theme_minimal()
```


#This plot shows that the type 5 stars are biggest in size. It also indicates the Spectral Class of stars.
```{r}
TypeSize <- ggplot(star_dataset, aes(x = Star.type, y = Radius.R.Ro.)) + geom_point(aes(colour = Spectral.Class)) +
labs(x = "Type", y = "Size")
TypeSize
```

#This plot shows that stars of spectral class B and O are bigger than others. It also indicates star types.
```{r}
ClassBright <- ggplot(star_dataset, aes(x = Spectral.Class, y = Luminosity.L.Lo.)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = Star.type)) +
  labs(x = "Spectral Class", y = "Brightness")
ClassBright

```

#This plot shows that stars of class B and O are bigger than others. This also hence proves that the brightness of a star is affected by its size as shows in plots 1, 2, 3.
```{r}
ClassSize <- ggplot(star_dataset, aes(x = Spectral.Class, y = Radius.R.Ro.)) + geom_point() +
labs(x = "Class", y = "Size") + geom_text(aes(label = Star.type, colour = Star.type), check_overlap = TRUE, size = 4, hjust = 1.5, yjust = 1.5)

ClassSize
```


#These two plot shows that there is no real relation between brightness and temprature of a star. If a star is the brightest then that does not mean that it's the hottest.
```{r}
TempBright <- ggplot(star_dataset, aes(x = Temperature..K., y = Luminosity.L.Lo.)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm") + labs(x = "Temprature", y = "Brightness", title = "Plot showing relation between temprature and brightness of a star.") + geom_density_2d() + theme_minimal()

TempBright
```


```{r}
star_dataset %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Temperature..K., y = Luminosity.L.Lo.)) + geom_point(aes(colour = Star.type)) + 
  labs(x = "Temprature", y = "Brightness", title = "Plot showing relation between temprature and brightness of a star.")
