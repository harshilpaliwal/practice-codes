ENTP,No; The way he connected things was very Ne. Ne dominates are just as aware of their environments as Se dominates.  Example: Shawn Spencer or Patrick Jane; Both ENTPs.

ENTP,;D I'll upload the same clip with the mic away from my mouth. Than you won't hear anything.  Ninja Assassin style but with splatter.

ENTP,"TBH, and biased, sounds like a shadowed INFP. I think maybe he was hurt and turned ESTJ. I can tell because he has some of the typical INFP traits left over."
ENTP,"*Checks list* I'm sorry. It seems that you have came at a bad time. We've already reached our quota of INFJs. However, being you're female and I like females I will make you a deal. I will kick one..."
ENTP,I'm ANTP (Leaning toward E). I'm easy for both ENTPs and INTPs to identify with. :)

ENTP,What? Me? I never do that >.> <.<
ENTP,Because its hard to be sad about losing someone you like when you knew you were right and give yourself a big pat on the back because you're awesome and always correct.
ENTP,"Oh, you don't have to tell me that most of them are stupid. I know this. That is why I play with them and it makes me laugh. :D As I'm going to take Neuropsychology and I have a few psychologist..."
ENTP,:D I'm a Nightowl. I wake up between 6-7pm and stay awake till 10-11:30am.
ENTP,Personal opinion backed by theory would suggest that INTPs are the most socially difficult. While INTJs can be socially indifferent but they will also use social situations if the the need arises....

INTP,This. Finally someone mentioned that :)
INTP,I still see creatures/faces in a maze of various random patterns. It can be amusing sometimes.  It's a very handy skill when you're bored.
INTP,"Oh, I didn't know that.. What a pity.  Why not sacrifice whole supermarket, then? We can decide which Walmart will be the best (I think the biggest one would be great)."

INTJ,I disagree.  Definite ESFJ. Fe- Si ALL up in this.
INTJ,Where have you been?  Your mother and I have been worried sick.
INTJ,Similar feelings concerning ENTPs.

INTJ,INFP- Edgar Allen Poe was an INFP and he's in your siggy.
INTJ,People see the obvious Fi and are quick to put her as INFP. I agree that she has no Ne. I see her as an ISFP. Compare her to Haku (definite INFP). She is flat through most of Naruto.. but I don't...
